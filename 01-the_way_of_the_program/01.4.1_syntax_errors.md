### 1.4.1 Syntax errors
F# can only execute a program if the syntax is correct; otherwise, the interpreter displays an error message.  
**Syntax** refers to the structure of a program and the rules about that structure. For example, parentheses 
have to come in matching pairs, so `(1 + 2)` is legal, but `8)` is a **syntax error**.

In English readers can tolerate most syntax errors, which is why we can read the poetry of e. e. cummings without 
spewing error messages. F# is not so forgiving.  If there is a single syntax error anywhere in your program, 
F# will display an error message and quit, and you will not be able to run your program. During the first few 
weeks of your programming career, you will probably spend a lot of time tracking down syntax errors. As you gain 
experience, you will make fewer errors and find them faster.
