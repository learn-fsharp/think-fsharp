### 1.4.2 Runtime errors
The second type of error is a runtime error, so called because the error does not appear until after the 
program has started running. These errors are also called **exceptions** because they usually indicate 
that something exceptional (and bad) has happened.

Runtime errors are rare in the simple programs you will see in the first few chapters, so it might be a 
while before you encounter one.
