### 1.4.3 Semantic errors
The third type of error is the **semantic error**.  If there is a semantic error in your program, it will 
run successfully in the sense that the computer will not generate any error messages, but it will not do the 
right thing.  It will do something else.  Specifically, it will do what you told it to do.

The problem is that the program you wrote is not the program you wanted to write.  The meaning of the program 
(its semantics) is wrong. Identifying semantic errors can be tricky because it generally requires you to work 
backward by looking at the output of the program and trying to figure out what it is doing.
