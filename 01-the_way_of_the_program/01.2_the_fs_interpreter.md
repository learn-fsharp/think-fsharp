## 1.2 - FSI, the F# interpreter

Let's take a moment to explain how to use the FSI interpreter. FSI 
works a little differently depending on your operating system. We will cover 
using FSI in Windows (10), MacOS (10.x), and Ubuntu (10.x).

One thing you will need to use are FSI commands known as **directives**. 
Directives tell the interpreter or compiler to do specific tasks, like load 
code from a file or exit. A list of some directives can be found at 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/fsharp/tutorials/fsharp-interactive/. One particularly
useful directive is `#quit;;`, which does exactly what it sounds like. Another good one is `#help;;` which
will display information about other useful directives.
