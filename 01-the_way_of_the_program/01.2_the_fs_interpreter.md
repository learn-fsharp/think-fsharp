## 1.2 - FSI, the F# interpreter

Let's take a moment to explain how to use the FSI interpreter. FSI 
works a little differently depending on your operating system. We will cover 
using FSI in Windows 7/8/10, MacOS 10.x, and Ubuntu 10.x.

One thing you will need to use are FSI commands known as **directives**. 
Directives tell the interpreter or compiler to do specific tasks, like load 
code from a file or exit. A list of some directives can be found at 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/fsharp/tutorials/fsharp-interactive/. One particularly
useful directive is `#quit;;`, which does exactly what it sounds like. Another good one is `#help;;` which
will display information about other useful directives.
