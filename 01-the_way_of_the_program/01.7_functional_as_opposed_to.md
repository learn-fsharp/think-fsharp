## 1.7 Functional, as opposed to...?
**Functional Programming** is a programming paradigm where the function is a
first-class citizen. Now, this is of course a silly definition, but it's the best we can really do for now.

Another popular programming paradigm is **Object-Oriented**. Languages that are object-oriented, such as C++, Java, C#,
and Python, focus rather on having "objects" and changing
them. "Object" is really kind of a blanket term for all kinds of different, often custom, ways of storing data.

F# is primarily a functional programming language. However, F# has support for object-oriented programming, like its predecesor OCaml, and unlike its ancestors ML and Caml. Supporting object-oriented programming means that F# can work well with the .NET library which is written with an object-oriented design.
