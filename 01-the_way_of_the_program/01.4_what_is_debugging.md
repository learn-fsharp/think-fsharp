## 1.4 What is debugging?
Programming is error-prone.  For whimsical reasons, programming errors are called **bugs** (It's not actually true that it's named after a moth found in a computer relay, though that does make for a rather amusing story. For more information on etymology, check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug) and the process of tracking them down is called **debugging**.

Three kinds of errors can occur in a program: syntax errors, runtime errors, and semantic errors. It is useful to distinguish between them in order to track them down more quickly.
