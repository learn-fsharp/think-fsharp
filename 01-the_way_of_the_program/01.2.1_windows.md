### Windows 7/8/10

First you must install F#. Go to the F# home page http://fsharp.org/ and go to the Windows download page http://fsharp.org/use/windows/. Follow the instructions there to install F# - if you don't know which one to choose, go with the Visual Studio Code with Ionide instructions. Run the installer and follow the directions therein.

You can now run FSI from the windows command line by typing `FSI` and hitting \<enter>. Alternatively,
Visual Studio Code (VSCode) has a very nice integration with FSI. Typing F# code in VSCode, selecting it, then hitting Alt-Enter will send that line to FSI.

Once in FSI, you can open a script by using the `#load "filename";;` directive:

```
> #load "myscript.fsx";;
[Loading C:\Users\me\myscript.fsx]
```

Note that FSI's **current directory** (the directory in which F# will look to find files to run, outside of the standard F# directories) will be the current directory when you ran it within the terminal. You can change your current directory using the `#cd dirname;;` directive.
