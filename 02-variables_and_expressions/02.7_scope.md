## 2.7 Scope

```
> let x = 2;;
val x : int = 2
> let x = 3;;
val x : int = 3;;
> x;;
val it : x = 3
```
See? The value of `x` changed! Didn't it?

Actually, the answer is no, it didn't. What we have here is a problem of **scope**. You see, variables
all act within certain bounds, or on certain levels within a program. Every time we say `let`, it kind of
creates a new `level` of the program, within which only certain variables can be accessed. This brings up
let's counterpart, `in`. The best way to explain `in` is with an example.

``` fsharp
> let x = 2;;
val x : int = 2
> let x = 3 in x+1;;
val it : int = 4
> x;;
val it : int = 2
```
Now, didn't see that last bit coming, did you? When you use `let... in...;;`, the value assigned by the `let` only
exists within the expression after `in`. This is called a `let-in-binding`.

**Exercise 2.2** Play around with scope a little bit in the command line.

See if you can predict the outcome of the following:
 
``` fsharp
> let x = 2 in x+1;;
> let x = 3 in x+1;;
> x;;
```
``` fsharp
> let x = 2;;
> let y = 3 in let x = 2 in x+y;;
> x;;
> y;;
```

Now try them out in the interpreter and see if you were right!
