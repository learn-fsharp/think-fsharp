### 2.10.2 Single-line comments
Single-line comments tend to be more common. They look like this:

``` fsharp
> let y = 3;; // I'm a single-line comment!!
``` 
Single-line comments start with a double-slash `//` and stop at the end of that line. So, unlike block comments, you can't put them before or in the middle of code.

``` fsharp
> let z = // a comment 3;;
```
That's not going to work!

However, single-line comments come in really handy when you want to temporarily disable lines of code to try different options:

``` fsharp
let pi = 3.1415927
//let poolRadius = 10
let poolRadius = 15
let poolDepth = 4
let poolVolume = (pi * (poolRadius ** 2)) * poolDepth
```
