## 2.5 Expressions
An **expression** is a combination of values, variables, operators
and functions that returns a particular value. A value all by itself 
is an expression, and so is a variable, so the following are all legal expressions (assuming that the variable `x` has been assigned a value):

``` fsharp
17;;
x;;
x + 17;;
```
If you type an expression in interactive mode, the interpreter
**evaluates** it and displays the result:
``` fsharp
> 1 + 1;;
val it : int = 2
```
Expressions can, and often do, (any expression with more than just a value or 
variable technically contains subexpressions.) contain other expressions, called **subexpressions**. When evaluating the value of the expression, the F# interpreter 
will evaluate the embedded expression and substitute it in to the larger expression. 
In F#, and many other function-oriented languages, everything must be an expression. 
Everything up to a double semi-colon `;;` must be exactly one expression, with 
arbitrarily many sub-expressions.

Type the following statements in the F# interpreter to see
what they do:

``` fsharp
5;;
let x = 5;;
x + 1;;
```
Now put the same statements into a script and run it.  What
is the output?
