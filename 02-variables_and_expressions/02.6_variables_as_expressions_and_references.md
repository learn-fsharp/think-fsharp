## 2.6 Variables and Expressions, and References
Now, this is where I admit that I lied to you a little bit.

Remember how I said that the expression `let x = 3;;` assigns
the value of `3` to the variable `x`? Well, that's not
entirely true. In fact, it's not true at all.

What really happens when I say `let x = 3;;` is that the  _expression_
`3` is represented by `x`. `x` becomes kind of a shorthand way of writing `3`.

One of the side effects of this is that (by default) you can't change the value of a variable.
So, really, in some sense, they shouldn't be called variables at all.
In fact most functional programmers prefer to just refer to them as _values_.
