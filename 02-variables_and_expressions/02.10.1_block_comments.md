### 2.10.1 Block comments
Block comments start with a `(*` and end with a `*)`:

``` fsharp
(* compute the percentage of the hour that has elapsed *)
percentage = (minute * 100) / 60
```
Everything between-and-including the parentheses will be ignored by the compiler/interpreter. 
You can also put block comments at the end, or even in the middle, of a line of code:

``` fsharp
> let x = 2;; (* I'm a comment! *)
val x : int = 2
> let x (* Hi, mom! *) = 3;;
val x = 3
```
Of course, putting comments in the middle of expressions like that can be really annoying to read.

Block comments can span multiple lines as well
``` fsharp
(* F Sharp treats these lines
   like so much thought in my mind
   never seen or heard *)
```
