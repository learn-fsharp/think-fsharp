## 2.8 Order of operations

When more than one operator appears in an expression, the order of
evaluation depends on the **rules of precedence**.  For
mathematical operators, F# follows mathematical convention.
The acronym **PEMDAS** is a useful way to
remember the rules:

   * **P**arentheses have the highest precedence and can be used to force an expression to evaluate in the order you want. Since expressions in parentheses are evaluated first, `2 * (3-1)` is 4, and `(1.0 + 1.0)**(5.0 - 2.0)` is 8.0. You can also use parentheses to make an expression easier to read, as in `(minute * 100) / 60`, even if it doesn't change the result.

    * **E**xponentiation has the next highest precedence, so `2.0 ** 1.0 + 1.0` is 3.0, not 4.0, and `3.0 * 1.0 ** 3.0` is 3.0, not 27.0.

    * **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision have the same precedence, which is higher than **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction, which also have the same precedence.  So `2 * 3 - 1` is 5, not 4, and `6 + 4 / 2` is 8, not 5.

    * Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left to right.  So in the expression `degrees / 2.0 * pi`, the division happens first and the result is multiplied by `pi`. To divide by 2Ï€, you can use parentheses or write `degrees / 2.0 / pi`.

Technically speaking, all operations in the programming language follow some sort
of order of operations. However, you don't really need to know more than that 
parentheses override all that precedence. In fact, if you need to know more about
the order of operations than the above mathematical rules, then you're not making
your code clear enough and should use parentheses to make things more clear.
