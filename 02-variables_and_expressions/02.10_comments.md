As programs get bigger and more complicated, they get more difficult
to read.  Formal languages are dense, and it is often difficult to
look at a piece of code and figure out what it is doing, or why.

For this reason, it is a good idea to add notes to your programs to explain in natural language what the program is doing (to you and other people; F# ignores them). These notes are called **comments**, and they come in two types: block, and single-line.
