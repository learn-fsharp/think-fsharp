### 2.7.1 Lightweight Syntax
F# programmers tend not to use `in` all that much though, because there is another way to define scope without it.

You see, F# has a "lightweight" syntax that has what's called **significant whitespace**. That means that whitespace (spaces) before a line of code means something, in particular it indicates scope. Take the following "let-in-binding":
``` fsharp
> let z = let x = 3 in let y = 5 in x + y;;

val z : int = 8
```
Using the lightweight syntax we can write it like this:
``` fsharp
> let z =
      let x = 3
      let y = 5
      x + y;;

val z : int = 8
```
Items that are indented are in-scope to everything coming after them that's indented by the same amount (in the same block). Some languages allow either spaces or tabs as whitespace, but F# only allows spaces. So if you prefer to use the tab key, make sure your editor is set to insert spaces for tabs.
