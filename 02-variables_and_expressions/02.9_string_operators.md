## 2.9 String operations
You cannot perform mathematical operations on strings, even
if the strings look like numbers, so the following are illegal:
```
"2" - "1"    "eggs" / "easy"    "third" * "a charm"
```
However, `+` as we mentioned earlier is the concatenation operator so:
``` fsharp
 "you" + "me"
```
is perfectly valid.

In F#, an operator can be used for more than one thing. Operators can be **overloaded**, meaning they do different
things in different situations (i.e., `+` can be used for string concatenation).
