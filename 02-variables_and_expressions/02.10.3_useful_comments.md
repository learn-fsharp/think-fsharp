### 2.10.3 Useful comments
Comments are most useful when they document non-obvious features of the code. It is reasonable to assume that the reader can figure out
_what_ the code does; it is much more useful to explain _why_.

This comment is redundant with the code and useless:

``` fsharp
let v = 5;;     (* assign 5 to v *)
```
This comment contains useful information that is not in the code:

``` fsharp
let v = 5;;     (* velocity in meters/second. *)

Good variable names can reduce the need for comments, but
names that are too long can make complex expressions hard to read, so there is a tradeoff.
