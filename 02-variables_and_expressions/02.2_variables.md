## 2.2 Variables
One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the
ability to manipulate **variables**.  A variable is a name that refers to a value.
In F#, variables _really_ refer to expressions, but don't worry about that for now.

An **assignment statement** creates new variable and gives them values:
``` fsharp
> let message = "Don't forget to buy milk.";;
val message : string = "Don't forget to buy milk."
> let n = 17;;
val n : int = 17
> let pi = 3.14159265;;
val pi : float = 3.14159265
```
This example makes three assignments.  The first assigns a string
to a new variable named `message`;
the second gives the integer `17` to `n`; the third
assigns the (approximate) value of Ï€ to `pi`.

A common way to represent variables on paper is to write the name with
an arrow pointing to the variable's value.  This kind of figure is
called a **state diagram** because it shows what state each of the
variables is in (think of it as the variable's state of mind).
This diagram shows the result of the previous example:
```
    message -> "Don't forget to buy milk."
          n -> 17
         pi -> 3.1415926535897931
```


To display the value of a variable, you can simply type it at the FSI prompt:

``` fsharp
> n;;
val n : int = 17
> pi;;
val pi : float = 3.14159265
```
